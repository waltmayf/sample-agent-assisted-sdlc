1. Read ./.dev-claude/project.json, ./.dev-claude/current/explore.md, and ./.dev-claude/issue.json.

DECISION RULES — ALWAYS HALT if any of these are true:

  A. explore.md contains a section titled "Ambiguities" or similar, AND that
     section lists one or more items. Surface each flagged ambiguity verbatim.

  B. The spec leaves ANY of these uncovered (each is high-blast-radius):
       - Error/None handling for external inputs
       - Numeric rounding (ceil vs floor vs round)
       - Default behavior when a flag/option is unspecified
       - Which files/paths the change touches, if multi-file
       - Exempt-from-rule lists (allowlists, denylists)

  C. Two or more requirements in the spec plausibly conflict.

OTHERWISE (spec is concrete on all of the above, AND explore.md's ambiguity
section is empty or absent):
  Write ./.dev-claude/current/questions.md containing only:
  "ANSWERED: no questions needed"
  Do not post a comment or change any labels. Exit.

WHEN HALTING:
  1. Write ./.dev-claude/current/questions.md with numbered questions (no ANSWERED marker).
  2. Post a single comment via mcp__gateway__github-issues___add_issue_comment
     listing all questions clearly.
  3. Set labels: ["agent:need-clarification"] via mcp__gateway__github-issues___issue_write.
  4. Exit — do not continue to implement-agent.

The orchestrator skips this agent if questions.md already has the ANSWERED marker.
